## qwert.pyw
A useful tool to manage the desktop files. when you select the file and drag them onto the link on the desktop (that is, `pythonw.exe qwert.pyw`) it will automaticly move them into the desktop directory and in the directory named after date of the Monday of the week. What's more, it uses the `SHFileOperation` which makes it looks just like what you use in the `explorer.exe`. And for historical reasons, its name was pretty confusing as `qwert.pyw`.
